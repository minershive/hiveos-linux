INFORMATIONS, NOTES AND LICENSES
==================================================================

If you get "Insufficient system resources available to allocate X kB in large-page memory" message, that means you dont have enough FREE memory left, a computer restart should solve this.
Large-page memory regions may be difficult to obtain after the system has been running for a long time because the physical space for each large page must be contiguous, but the memory may have become fragmented.
If you still get this message even after restarting, try increasing virtual memory.
