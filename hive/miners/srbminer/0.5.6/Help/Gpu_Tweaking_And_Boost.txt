Supported:

If you previously started a monitoring software like HWinfo or GPU-Z, tweaks can't get applied, a machine restart is needed!



--gpu-tweak-profile

1. Miner must run with administrator/root privileges
2. Be patient, it takes some time to find optimal settings for your gpu/rig. Always test 1 card at a time.
3. If you start getting invalid shares or compute errors, that means the profile is too much for that gpu, so lower it.

Tweak levels 0 - 10 :

0 - no change, uses your original settings
1 - light tweak
2
3
4
10 - max tweak

Not every gpu can handle the same profile, so you need to find the right one for every gpu you have.
Every profile has also weaker (low) settings. To use the low profile, add L after the profile number ( example: --gpu-tweak-profile 5L )

If using config file, you must surround the value with quotation marks if you want to use the L profile. Example : "5L"


--gpu-boost

1. Miner must run with administrator/root privileges
2. If you start getting invalid shares or compute errors, that means the boost value is too much for that gpu, so lower it.

This option is same as the famous 'rx-boost' which can be found in other miners. 
It's value goes from 0 to 50.
