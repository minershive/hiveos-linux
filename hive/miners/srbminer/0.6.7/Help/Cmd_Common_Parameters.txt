--enable-restart-on-rejected    (enable miner auto restart on too many rejected shares. Set number with --max-rejected-shares)
--extended-log                  (enable more informative logging)
--forced-shutdown               (never try to free resources on restart/shutdown)
--give-up-limit value           (number of times to try connecting to a pool before switching to the next pool)
--gpu-auto-tune value           (runs miner in a mode that tries to find best settings per GPU. 0-disabled, 1-normal, 2-fast [def. is 2])
--gpu-errors-alert value        (notify when number of result validation errors for any GPU reaches this value [def. is 0 - disabled])
--gpu-watchdog-disable-mode     (if enabled, watchdog will try to disable crashed gpu, instead of restarting miner)
--list-algorithms               (list available algorithms)
--list-devices                  (list available gpu devices)
--log-file filename             (enable logging to file)

--multi-algorithm-job-mode value(how miner handles jobs when mining multiple algorithms. 0-no redirect, 1-redirect to a0, 2-redirect to first available, 3-redirect a1 to a0 only if a0 not working. def. is 0)
--pools-file filename           (use pools file other than pools.txt)
--reboot-script-gpu-watchdog    (filename, if set it turns off built in restart procedure on gpu failure, and instead runs this script)
--retry-time value              (time, how much to wait before trying to reconnect to a pool)
--reset-vega                    (disable/enable Vega video cards on miner start)
--set-compute-mode              (sets AMD gpu's to compute mode & disables crossfire - run as admin)
--setup                         (interactive mode to create basic configuration)
--startup-script filename       (run custom script on miner start - set clocks, voltage, etc.)
--shutdown-temperature value    (if this temperature is reached, miner will shutdown system (ADL must be enabled))
--watchdog-rounds value         (after how many rounds (round is 30 sec) to trigger gpu-watchdog. def. is 3)


; is used to separate algorithms, ! is used to separate parameters for an algorithm
On Linux you need to escape the ; character with a backslash! ( \; )
When setting any of the parameters don't use " or ' around the value!
Parameters that take a TIME value must be set in SECONDS!
