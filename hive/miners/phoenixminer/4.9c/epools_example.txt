# PhoenixMiner ethash pools list (you MUST rename this files to epools.txt in order to use it)
#
# The pools specified in this file will be added to the pools specified with the PhoenixMiner's
# command-line options (see -pool and -pool2 command line options).
# 
# Alternatively, you can omit the -pool option on the command-line and use only the pools in
# epools.txt file. This will give you the ability to specify more than two pools, and to change
# the pools without restarting the miner by using the 'r' key in the PhoenixMiner console to
# reload the epools.txt file.
#
# You must put one pool per line as specified in the examples below
# If the line starts with '#' it will be ignored as comment
#
# NOTE: PhoenixMiner also "understands" the epools.txt files from Claymore's dual Ethereum miner
