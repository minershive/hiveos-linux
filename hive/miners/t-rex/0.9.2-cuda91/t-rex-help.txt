This is T-Rex NVIDIA GPU miner.

We hope you enjoy our miner.
We promise to do our best to make it as	fast as possible.

However, in order to maximise the hashrate our software utilises all
available GPU resources, so it is important that you review your overclock
settings before you start mining. Our general recommendation is to start
from GPU stock settings	(no overclock, default power limit), and then after
making sure it is stable, slowly increase your overclock to find the
"sweet spot" where the miner performs at its best and still does not crash.

=========================================== JSON CONFIG USAGE ==========================================

To start T-Rex with config file "config.txt" type in console: t-rex -c config.txt

Use "config_example" file as a starting point to create your own config.

============================================ WATCHDOG USAGE ============================================

Watchdog is intended to observe miner state and restart T-Rex if it crashes or hungs for any reason.
Also, watchdog can optionally perform auto updates if a newer version is available.
Use watchdog as you use T-Rex. Simply replace t-rex.exe with watchdog.exe in your bat/script file in order to use it.
We recommend using the watchdog to avoid any downtime in mining and make sure your GPUs are busy 24/7.

============================================ HTTP API USAGE ============================================

For HTTP API there are a few handlers available.

By default HTTP API server binds to 0.0.0.0:4067. It means that you can access your miner via both external and internal network interfaces.
Common example of request structure: http://your_ip:your_port/handler_name

==[ TREX ]==

Handler "trex" is intended to show miner control monitoring page in your web browser. You can see miner stats realtime and also change miner parameters and config on the fly. Also here you will see updates in case it appears.
To activate the handler navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4067/trex using a web browser.

==[ CONFIG ]==

Handler "config" is intended to change your config on HDD and also change some miner parameters on the fly.
You can change multiple parameters with one request. GET and POST requests supported.
If you use config (started miner like this: t-rex.exe -c config_file) then any action with handler "config" will be saved into selected config_file.
You can use this handler for automatization purposes like changing config at runtime, shutting down the miner via API and then restarting it with new parameters applied.

GET usage examples:
1) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?protocol-dump=true   
Will enable protocol dump on the fly and write it into config_file.

2) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?algo=x16r&devices=0,1&intensity=20,21  
If you use config it will write the following config settings into it:
algo=x16r
devices=0,1
intensity=20,21 

3) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?algo=x16r&devices=0,1&intensity=20,21&config=test.conf
Will save settings into the file "test.conf" which will be created in the folder where the miner resides.
algo=x16r
devices=0,1
intensity=20,21 

4) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?config=test.conf
Will save your current miner settings into "test.conf" file.

5) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config
Will show you the current config state

6) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?hashrate_avr=10&temperature-limit=70&temperature-start=40
Will set following parameters on the fly:
hashrate_avr=10
temperature-limit=70
temperature-start=40

POST usage examples:
For POST requests you must use correct json object with parameters you want to change.
http://127.0.0.1:4067/config
POST payload:
{
"hashrate_avr": 10,
"temperature-limit": 70,
"temperature-start": 40
}
Parameters names and types in json are identical to config json you use.


==[ SUMMARY ]==

Handler "summary" is intended to show you all information about current mining process.
To activate the handler navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4067/summary using a web browser.

==[ DO-UPDATE ]==

Handler "do-update" is intended to activate download update service.
To start T-Rex update type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/do-update

To stop update type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/do-update?stop=true

==[ CONTROL ]==

Handler "control" is needed for real time configuration of T-Rex miner.
As of API 1.3 version there are following commands supported.

--- shutdown ---

To shutdown your miner with GET request type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/control?command=shutdown

If you prefer POST set the request body to {"command": "shutdown"}.


--- hashrate-avr ---

To change sliding window size in real time with GET request type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
