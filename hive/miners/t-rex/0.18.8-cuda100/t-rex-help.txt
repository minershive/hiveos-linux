  This is T-Rex NVIDIA GPU miner version 0.18.8 rev.bab80bbb5f1c.

  We hope you enjoy our miner.
  We promise to do our best to make it as fast as possible.

  However, in order to maximise the hashrate our software utilises all
  available GPU resources, so it is important that you review your overclock
  settings before you start mining. Our general recommendation is to start
  from GPU stock settings (no overclock, default power limit), and then after
  making sure it is stable, slowly increase your overclock to find the
  "sweet spot" where the miner performs at its best and still does not crash.

        --coin                     [Ethash, ProgPOW] Set coin name.
                                   Helps avoid DAG rebuilds when switching back from a dev fee session.
                                   Example: "eth" for Ethereum, "zil" for Zilliqa.
        --extra-dag-epoch          Allocate extra DAG at GPU for specified epoch. Can be useful for dual mining
                                   of coins like Zilliqa (ZIL). (eg: --extra-dag-epoch 0)
        --nonce-start              [ProgPOW] Starting nonce for the solution search.

                                   Reduces the load on the GPUs if possible. Can be set to a comma separated string to enable
                                   the mode for a subset of the GPU list (eg: --low-load 0,0,1,0)
        --kernel                   Choose kernel for Ethash (default: 0). Range from 0 to 5.
                                   Set to 0 to enable auto-tuning: the miner will benchmark each kernel and select the fastest.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   (eg: --kernel 2,1,1,3)
                                   The support for this parameter may later be extended to cover other algorithms.
        --gpu-init-mode            Enables DAG sequential initialization (default: 0).
                                   0 - all GPUs are initialized in parallel
                                   1 - fully sequential initialization, one GPU at a time
                                   2 - two GPUs at a time
                                   etc.

        --fork-at                  Forces miner to change algorithm on predefined condition.
                                   Time condition: algo_name=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS (eg: --fork-at x16rv2=2019-10-01T16:00:00).
                                   Time must be set in UTC+0.
                                   Block condition: algo_name=integer_block_number (eg: --fork-at x16rv2=6526421).
                                   To change main pool port you must write it right after algo: algo_name:integer_port_number
                                   (eg: --fork-at x16rv2:4081=2019-10-01T16:00:00).

        --mt                       Memory tweak mode (default: 0 - disabled). Range from 0 to 6. General recommendation
                                   is to start with 1, and then increase only if the GPU is stable.
                                   The effect is similar to that of ETHlargementPill.
                                   Supported on graphics cards with GDDR5 or GDDR5X memory only.
                                   Requires running the miner with administrative privileges.
                                   Can be set to a comma separated list to apply different values to different cards.
                                   Example: --mt 4 (applies tweak mode #4 to all cards that support this functionality)
                                            --mt 3,3,3,0 (applies tweak mode #3 to all cards except the last one)

        --version                  Display version information and exit.
    -h, --help                     Display this help text and exit.

=========================================== JSON CONFIG USAGE ==========================================

To start T-Rex with config file "config.txt" type in console: t-rex -c config.txt

Use "config_example" file as a starting point to create your own config.

============================================ WATCHDOG ==================================================

Watchdog is intended to observe miner state and restart T-Rex if it crashes or hangs for any reason.
Also, watchdog can optionally perform auto updates if a newer version is available.
We recommend using the watchdog to avoid any downtime in mining and make sure your GPUs are busy 24/7.

============================================ HTTP API USAGE ============================================

For HTTP API there are a few handlers available.

By default HTTP API server binds to 0.0.0.0:4067. It means that you can access your miner via both external and internal network interfaces.
Common example of request structure: http://your_ip:your_port/handler_name

==[ TREX ]==

Handler "trex" is intended to show miner control monitoring page in your web browser. You can see miner stats realtime and also change miner parameters and config on the fly. Also here you will see updates in case it appears.
To activate the handler navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4067/trex using a web browser.

==[ LOG ]==
Displays the contents of the log file (if configured).
To activate the handler navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4067/log using a web browser.

==[ CONFIG ]==

Handler "config" is intended to change your config on HDD and also change some miner parameters on the fly.
You can change multiple parameters with one request. GET and POST requests supported.
If you use config (started miner like this: t-rex.exe -c config_file) then any action with handler "config" will be saved into selected config_file.
You can use this handler for automatization purposes like changing config at runtime, shutting down the miner via API and then restarting it with new parameters applied.

GET usage examples:
1) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?protocol-dump=true   
Will enable protocol dump on the fly and write it into config_file.

2) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?algo=x16r&devices=0,1&intensity=20,21  
If you use config it will write the following config settings into it:
algo=x16r
devices=0,1
intensity=20,21 

3) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?algo=x16r&devices=0,1&intensity=20,21&config=test.conf
Will save settings into the file "test.conf" which will be created in the folder where the miner resides.
algo=x16r
devices=0,1
intensity=20,21 

4) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?config=test.conf
Will save your current miner settings into "test.conf" file.

5) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config
Will show you the current config state

6) http://127.0.0.1:4067/config?hashrate_avr=10&temperature-limit=70&temperature-start=40
Will set following parameters on the fly:
hashrate_avr=10
temperature-limit=70
temperature-start=40

POST usage examples:
For POST requests you must use correct json object with parameters you want to change.
http://127.0.0.1:4067/config
POST payload:
{
"hashrate_avr": 10,
"temperature-limit": 70,
"temperature-start": 40
}
Parameters names and types in json are identical to config json you use.


==[ SUMMARY ]==

Handler "summary" is intended to show you all information about current mining process.
To activate the handler navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4067/summary using a web browser.

To stop update type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/do-update?stop=true

==[ CONTROL ]==

Handler "control" is needed for real time configuration of T-Rex miner.
As of API 1.3 version there are following commands supported.

--- shutdown ---

To shutdown your miner with GET request type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/control?command=shutdown

If you prefer POST set the request body to {"command": "shutdown"}.


--- hashrate-avr ---

To change sliding window size in real time with GET request type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/control?hashrate-avr=1
It will set sliding window of size 1 sec.

If you prefer POST set the request body to {"hashrate-avr": 1}.


--- gpu-report-interval ---

To change frequency of GPUs reports appearance in log with GET request type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/control?gpu-report-interval=10
Now you will see GPUs stats every 10th share.

If you prefer POST set the request body to {"gpu-report-interval": 10}.

Btw, you can disable stats (enter quiet mode) by setting gpu-report-interval to 0.


--- no-color ---

To disable color output to console with GET request type in the following into your browser address bar and hit Enter:
http://127.0.0.1:4067/control?no-color=true
