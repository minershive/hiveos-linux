--help, -h          Show short help.
--server            Stratum server only hostname or ip address.
--port              Stratum server port.
--user              Stratum user.
--pass              Stratum password.
--cuda_devices      Space-separated list of cuda devices. Without this option all devices are used.
--solver            Disable benchmark and use specified solver. Allowed values from 0 to 3.
                    Started from version 0.3.0b this option allow you to set the solver for each card separately at this manner: --solver 0 0 0 0
                    For example if you have 4 cuda devices and you do not use option --cuda_devices 
                    then --solver 0 1 2 3 will be applied to devices 0 1 2 3 accordingly.
                    if you set --solver 0 then this value will be applied to all devices
                    if you set --cuda_devices 3 2 1 then solver values will be applied in this order.
--eexit             Exit in case of error. Value 1 exit if miner cannot restart workers.
                    Value 2 if lost connection with the pool. 3 both cases.
--log               Create file miner.log in directory of miner.
                    Allowed values 1 and 2. 1 only errors, 2 will repeat console output.
--logfile           Set custom filename.
--config            Specifies the configuration file, when the configuration file is used, all other command-line parameters are ignored.
--intensity         Specifies maximum intensity, allowed values 1 - 64. Lower value, lower speed and gpu usage.
--tempunits         Temperature units, allowed values: C for celsius, F for fahrenheit and K for kelvin :)).
--templimit         Temperature limit, gpu will be stopped if this limit is reached.
                    And when temperature go below this limit gpu will be runned again.
                    Note: If this limit is too low and miner stops this gpu too frequently 
                    and option --eexit equal 1 or 3 then after three unsuccessfull starting attempts miner will exit.
--api               Enable api without an argument will be listen on 127.0.0.1:42000,
                    You can set listen address as an argument for example: --api 0.0.0.0:12345
                    Allowed ports 1000 - 65535.





API Description.
Api establish the tcp connection and send through it json data, like a stratum protocol.
Every json request and response must be ended with new line symbol \n, this symbol used 
as a sign of data end. 

Request example: {"id":1, "method":"getstat"}\n
Respond example: {"id":1, "method":"getstat", "error":null, "result":[{
		"gpuid":0, 
		"cudaid":0,

Since version 0.3.4b api is available through simple http request: 
you can simply make http request to api address in this format: http://127.0.0.1:42000/"method name"
for example http://127.0.0.1:42000/getstat
also you can open http://127.0.0.1:42000 this will show you simple web page with miner statistics

At this moment supported only one method "getstat".
If you have some thoughts about api you can send me personal message https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=927785
