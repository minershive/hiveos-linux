# ZM supports configuration via configuration files.
# Configuration files are used if the '--cfg-file' option is given on the
# command line. All additional command line options are ignored in this case.
# Options are grouped into sections - each option is a 'key=value(s)' pair.
# Lists of values are separated by ',' (spaces are not allowed).
# Comments start with '#'.

# ZM supports the setup of multiple pools.
# Pools are ordered by their priority. Higher priority pools are configured
# above lower priority pools in this file. ZM connects to the highest priority
# pool which is reachable. If a pool gets unreachable a lower priority pool will
# be used. ZM reconnects to a higher priority pool automatically if it gets
# reachable again.
