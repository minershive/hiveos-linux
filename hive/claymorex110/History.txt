v10.0 Beta
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- now miner uses the latest framework which is used for dual and zec miners. Therefore several new options are available.
- new assembler GPU kernels are used.
- added "-dmem" options that can improve performance in many cases. Note that twice more GPU memory is used in this mode.
- some old options were removed, some were renamed, please read Readme for detailed information and samples.
- reduced devfee, it's 1% now if you use secure SSL/TLS connection, 1.5% for unsecure connection.
